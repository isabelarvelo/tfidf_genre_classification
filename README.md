#  Utilizing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for Genre Classification 

This analysis aims to address this challenge by building a Naive Bayes classifier that utilizes the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique
to classify books as either science fiction or historical fiction based on their plot summaries.

## Research Questions 

Research Questions:
1. What are the most informative words or phrases in plot summaries that distinguish science fiction from historical fiction books?
2.  How effective is the combination of TF-IDF feature representation and different machine learning classification models in accurately classifying books into science
fiction or historical fiction genres based on their plot summaries?

## Data 

The corpus for this project is a subset of data from the CMU Book Summary Corpus (Bamman & Smith, 2013), a collection of 16,559 book plot summaries extracted from
Wikipedia, along with aligned metadata from Freebase (a massive, collaboratively edited database of cross-linked data with data from users and sources such as Wikipedia),
including book author, title, and genre. The data used in this study is too large to uploade directly into GitHub, but can be downloaded from this 
[link](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/booksummaries.html).

## Analysis 

The code for this analysis can be found in and and reproduced using `data-assignment-2-ia.ipynb`.
